### Homeowner Information

#### Create Resource:
1. Take an XML document, parses it. [Here i am using an XAL document to parse the data, this can be esily changed to reading an XML document as part of get request. This app is not designed to read very large XML file]
2. Calculate the homeownerâ€™s age based on the supplied Date of Birth
